## How to launch application
1. Install requirements.txt by 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
2. First you need to create an account at `https://app.mailvalidation.io/accounts/signup/`
3. Get Team name (When you sign up you have a team, its in the URL then use that)
4. Get API KEY `https://mailvalidation.io/support/email-validation-api-key/`
5. Make them environment variables if you don't, there will be error.
- `export API_KEY='your api key'`

## Explaing the import part of the project

I think you know most part of the codes by looking at it. A few code need to explain so I am here to explain it.

### Email validation

I check a email is a valid or not in two ways. First I check with [email_validator](https://pypi.org/project/email-validator/) and then I check with [mailvalidation](https://mailvalidation.io/) API by creating a function inside the 'helpers.py' file then use this function in /register route that is in 'app.py' file.

```
from email_validator import validate_email, EmailNotValidError

def email_validation(email):
    """Accept email and check it is valid or not"""
    try:
        validation = validate_email(email, check_deliverability=False)
        email = validation.email
    except EmailNotValidError as e:
        print(str(e))
        return False

    # API Validation from https://mailvalidation.io/
    api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
    team_slug = os.environ.get("TEAM_SLUG")

    response = requests.post(
        "https://app.mailvalidation.io/a/" + team_slug + "/validate/api/validate/",
        json={'email': email},
        headers={
            'content-type': 'application/json',
            'accept': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': 'Api-Key ' + api_key,
        })

    valid = response.json()["is_valid"]

    return valid
```

```
# Ensure email was validated
if not email_validation(email):
    return apology("invalid email")
```

### Using Python libray called pathlib
when you log in, The web app is going to create a folder named with your session user id and inside that folder create two more folder named audio and image. I used python [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) library to create folders, to add files and delete files.

#### Create folders
```
session["user_id"] = rows[0]["id"]

session['static'] = Path('static')

session['my-folder'] = session['static'] / str(session['user_id'])
session['my-image'] = session['my-folder'] / 'image'
session['my-audio'] = session['my-folder'] / 'audio'

if not session['my-folder'].exists():
    session['my-folder'].mkdir()
    session['my-image'].mkdir()
    session['my-audio'].mkdir()
```

#### Add files
```
ef insert(route, db):
    title = request.form.get(route + "-title-name")
    if not title:
        return apology("must prove title")

    if route not in request.files:
        return apology("must provide " + route + " file")
    file = request.files[route]
    if file.filename == "":
        return apology("must provide image file")

    date = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

    id = db.execute("INSERT INTO ?(user_id, title, date) VALUES(?, ?, ?)",
                    route + "s", session['user_id'], title, date)

    path = str(session[f"my-{route}"] / str(id))
    rows = [{"id": id, "user_id": session["user_id"],
             "title": title, "date": date}]
    file.save(path)

    return jsonify(rows)
```

#### Delete files
```
@app.route("/delete/<what>", methods=["POST"])
@login_required
def delete(what):
    if what == "note":
        data = request.json
        db.execute("DELETE FROM notes WHERE user_id = ? AND id = ?",
                   session["user_id"], data.get("id"))
    elif what == "image":
        data = request.json
        db.execute("DELETE FROM images WHERE user_id = ? AND id = ?",
                   session["user_id"], data.get("id"))
        path = session['my-image'] / data.get("id")
        path.unlink()
    elif what == "audio":
        data = request.json
        db.execute("DELETE FROM audios WHERE user_id = ? AND id = ?",
                   session["user_id"], data.get("id"))
        path = session['my-audio'] / data.get("id")
        path.unlink()
    return jsonify("yes")
```

### MINIFIER
>Making websites smaller and faster to load

I use minifer to minify Javascript files and CSS files but you shouldn't used it for HTML files that include jinja syntax. It won't work. `https://freecodetools.org/minifier/`
